# expected usage:
# 0) clone the source code to be built onto the build machine
# 1) mount the source code rootdir to the internal path /build
# 2) mount the wheel output directory to the internal path /output
# 3) call this script with a script argument indicating the python version
#    you want to build a manylinux wheel for (e.g. version cp36-cp36m)

# call this script like in following example (using the manylinux1 build env):
# docker run -v $PWD/dist:/output -v $PWD:/build -it \
#        quay.io/pypa/manylinux1_x86_64 \
#        bash /build/build_manylinux.sh cp36-cp36m

# ===========================================================================

# retrieve the python version to build for as script argument
PYTHON_VERSION=$1

# define the manylinux build toolchain path for the given python
# version that the chesslib wheels should be built for
PYTHON_ROOT=/opt/python/$PYTHON_VERSION/bin

# install the chesslib build dependencies (according to requirements.txt file)
$PYTHON_ROOT/pip install -r /build/requirements.txt

# build the chesslib wheel for the given python version
cd /build && $PYTHON_ROOT/pip wheel /build -w /output-out

echo 'created intermediate wheel file'
ls /output-out

# use the auditwheel tool to convert the wheel into a generic manywheel
# artifact that gets written to the /output directory 
auditwheel repair /output-out/chesslib*$PYTHON_VERSION*.whl -w /output

echo 'created manylinux wheel file'
ls /output/*$PYTHON_VERSION*

# TODO: add some kind of verification that the build was successful
